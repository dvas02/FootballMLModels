Comparing Machine Learning Models from NFL/NCAA to Canadian Equivalent

The purpose of this project is to create machine learning models for key metrics in professional american football (notably whether a play will be a pass or run) that are on par with current top of the line metrics. Then take these models, apply them to Canadian football leagues and make them as accurate as possible. Then, compare the American data to Canadian data to make relevant statistical findings of difference and equivalence between the two games. The end goal would be to notice where the two leagues have similar qualities and where they differ and perhaps delve into why these differences appear.
